Angus Mail gives AutoJs6 scripts a global `mail` object for sending messages, listing and searching mailboxes, reading bodies, downloading attachments, managing flags and folders, and watching a folder for new mail. It is built on [Eclipse Angus Mail](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/angus-mail/) 2.0.5, the reference implementation of Jakarta Mail, and speaks IMAP, POP3, and SMTP over TLS.

Version 1.0.0 is in development: the repository skeleton, the mail core with its local-server tests, and the plugin identity for the AutoJs6 plugin center are in place, while the Binder contract, the script API, and the settings page follow the phases of [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/SuperMonster003/AutoJs6-Plugin-Angus-Mail/blob/master/ROADMAP.md). Requires AutoJs6 6.8.0 (build 5281) or later.

### Usage

1. Install the plugin APK from [Releases](https://github.com/SuperMonster003/AutoJs6-Plugin-Angus-Mail/releases) on a device with AutoJs6 build 5281 (6.8.0) or later.
2. Open the AutoJs6 plugin center, confirm that `Angus Mail` is recognized, and enable it.
3. Prepare the account: turn on IMAP or POP3 in your mail provider's settings and obtain an authorization code or app password (QQ, 163, 126, Gmail, iCloud), or an OAuth 2.0 access token (Outlook.com).
4. Call `mail.connect(...)` in a script, or save the account on the plugin's settings page and connect by alias.
